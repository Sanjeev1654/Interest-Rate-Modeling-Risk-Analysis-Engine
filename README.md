Interest Rate Analysis and Risk Modeling
General Idea of the Project

Implements a quantitative finance model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Focus areas may include (based on notebook content):

Portfolio Optimization (e.g., Efficient Frontier, Sharpe Ratio Maximization)

Risk Modeling (e.g., Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, Monte Carlo Simulation)

Pricing Models (e.g., Black–Scholes, Binomial Tree)

Backtesting Trading Strategies with historical data

Provides tools to measure:

Expected Returns

Portfolio Volatility

Correlation and Covariance between assets

Risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, etc.)

⚙️ Requirements

Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Software: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used (common for quant projects):

pandas (data analysis)

numpy (numerical computing)

matplotlib (data visualization)

scipy (scientific computing)

yfinance (fetching stock market data)

cvxpy or scikit-learn (if optimization/machine learning is used)
